        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese. A traditional reuben sandwich consists of thinly sliced corned beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut on rye bread slathered with Russian or Thousand Island dressing.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices rye bread</li>
            <li>1/8 cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
            <li>1 slice of Swiss Cheese</li>
            <li>2 slices deli sliced corned beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sauerkraut, drained</li>
            <li>1/4 tablespoon butter softened</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Spread one side of bread slices evenly with Thousand Island dressing.</li>
            <li>On four bread slices, layer one slice Swiss cheese, 2 slices corned beef, 1/4 cup sauerkraut, and a second slice of Swiss cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, dressing-side down. Butter the top of each sandwich.</li>
            <li>Place sandwiches, butter-side down on the preheated griddle; butter the top of each sandwich with remaining butter. Grill until both sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Serve hot. Enjoy!</li>
