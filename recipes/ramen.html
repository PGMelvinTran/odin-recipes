        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tonkatsu ramen is a rich and creamy Japanese noodle soup made from pork bones simmered over many hours to extract deep flavor and collagen, resulting in a hearty, milky broth. 
            To make it, pork bones (like neck bones or trotters) 
            are boiled briefly, cleaned, then simmered with aromatics like onion, garlic, and ginger for 6 to 12 hours. The long cooking time breaks down the bones and marrow, creating that signature thick and flavorful base. 
            This broth is then combined with a tare—a simple seasoning sauce made from soy sauce, mirin, and sake—that gives the soup its salty umami punch. </p>
        <p>When serving, hot broth is ladled over ramen noodles and topped with classic garnishes like slices of chashu pork, soft-boiled eggs, green onions, nori, and sometimes corn or bamboo shoots. 
            The result is a deeply satisfying bowl of ramen that’s warming, savory, and packed with layers of flavor and texture. Though it takes time, the process is straightforward and well worth the effort for a comforting homemade bowl of tonkatsu ramen.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 lbs pork bones (neck bones or trotters work well)</li>
                <li>1 onion, halved</li>
                <li>5 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
                <li>1 knob (2-inch) ginger, sliced</li>
                <li>2 green onions (optional)</li>
                <li>Water (enough to cover bones)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tbsp mirin</li>
                <li>1 tbsp sake (optional)</li>
                <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h4>Prepare the broth (can be made a day ahead)</h4>
            <ol>
            <li>Rinse pork bones under cold water</li>
            <li>Place bones in a large pot, fill with water, and bring to a boil</li>

            <li>Fill with fresh water to cover the bones</li>
            <li>Simmer uncovered for 6–12 hours, adding water as needed. The longer it simmers, the creamier and richer it gets</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar</li>

            </ol>
